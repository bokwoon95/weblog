Achieving sorting via URL Year/Month/Day grouping is incredibly niche, as a dedicated page with full text search and date ranges is going to be better in every case. Might as well leave your URLs evergreen.

post searching
skip links
sitemaps
RSS feeds
translations?
categories? tags?
    even if no categories or tags, I still want some way for the user to bundle their posts into discrete groups.
    the good thing about groups is, you can actually organize posts in entirely arbitrary ways. Like, creating a group for C++ or Java or Python or Qt tutorials like zetcode does.
robots.txt? robots meta tags? (ahrefs has post on it)
canonical links?
I need some way to exclude links to dynamic pages when generating a static copy.
